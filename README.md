A simple bot that posts ranodm textbook snippets to twitter.

fill in your oAuth kys in the code, then run it with "python tweeter.py input.txt" where input.txt is a plaintext version of the textbook you want to use.
(really, it could be anything, not just a textbook).

requires python (duh) as well as tweepy (downloadable though pip).
